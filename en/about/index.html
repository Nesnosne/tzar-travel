<h1>About <em>Us</em></h1>



    <p>Having started in&nbsp;2008&nbsp;as a&nbsp;one person company, I&rsquo;ve developed it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;full scale project. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;10&nbsp;highly qualified, hand-picked guides who share my&nbsp;vision of&nbsp;what a&nbsp;tour should&nbsp;be. Some of&nbsp;them are Art
        History majors like myself.</p>

    <p>I&nbsp;continue guiding myself occasionally. My&nbsp;personal assistant Anastasia helps to&nbsp;keep things running.</p>

    <p>Professional experienced drivers and high quality comfortable vehicles is&nbsp;something we&nbsp;are very serious about.</p>

    <p><img src="/en/about/i/GERMAN-TSARKOVA.jpg" width="100%" alt="german-tsarkova family"/></p>

    <p>Guiding is&nbsp;something&nbsp;I really enjoy. For me&nbsp;it&rsquo;s very easy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;guide in&nbsp;St. Petersburg. This city inspires you instantaneously. Its&rsquo; architecture, breathtaking vistas with great open spaces, numerous palaces, canals, embankments and gardens
        are unforgettable. The charm of&nbsp;St.Petersburg is&nbsp;disarming.</p>

    <p>My&nbsp;background in&nbsp;art history makes my&nbsp;tours informative, but yet entertaining. I&nbsp;tell interesting facts and stories from the past that make history come alive.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been living in&nbsp;St.Petersburg for 20&nbsp;years. My&nbsp;childhood was spent in&nbsp;the south of&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;&mdash; Rostov-on-Don. We&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;Leiningrad in&nbsp;1989 and since then, this city became a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;soul. </p>

    <p>Studying at&nbsp;the Art Academy was a&nbsp;real pleasure, as&nbsp;well. It&nbsp;was founded in&nbsp;1757 and most of&nbsp;the outstanding architects, artists and sculptors of&nbsp;Russia came out of&nbsp;the that school.</p>

    <p>I&nbsp;have all the necessary licenses for museums in&nbsp;St.Petersburg. I&nbsp;am married and have three kids: two daughters (11&nbsp;and&nbsp;9) and a&nbsp;son who is&nbsp;19&nbsp;months old. My&nbsp;job allows me&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend enough time with my&nbsp;children, which makes me&nbsp;feel
        really comfortable.</p>

    <h3 class="oswald">The &laquo;<em>Russian Ark</em>&raquo;</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, I&nbsp;help my&nbsp;mother with various projects of&nbsp;hers. I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;tell you about two most outstanding ones. In&nbsp;2001&nbsp;I took part in&nbsp;the filming of&nbsp;the &laquo;Russian Ark&raquo;&nbsp;&mdash; the film by&nbsp;Alexander Sokurov. It&nbsp;took
        place in&nbsp;the State Hermitage Museum; it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;unique film even from a&nbsp;technical point of&nbsp;view because it&nbsp;was taken in&nbsp;one continuous
        <nobr>90-minute</nobr>
        shot. Here are just some reviews on&nbsp;this film in&nbsp;the foreign press:

    <p>The &laquo;Russian Ark&raquo; was a&nbsp;great success at&nbsp;the Cannes Film Festival of&nbsp;2002.</p>

    <p>I&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the 900&nbsp;participants, an&nbsp;extra player dressed up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the beautiful red velvet dress of&nbsp;the lady- in-waiting of&nbsp;the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, wife of&nbsp;Nicholas II. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;arrive to&nbsp;the Hermitage at&nbsp;11:00&nbsp;pm.
        When I&nbsp;came in&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t believe my&nbsp;eyes: the Hermitage came to&nbsp;life&nbsp;&mdash; hundreds of&nbsp;men in&nbsp;women dressed up&nbsp;in&nbsp;historical costumes looked incredibly authentic in&nbsp;the interiors of&nbsp;the Hermitage</p>

    <h3 class="oswald">Costumed Charity Ball by&nbsp;<em>Richard Caring</em></h3>

    <p>I&nbsp;happened to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;another outstanding event. <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2008/12/caring200812" title="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Costumed Charity Ball, arranged by&nbsp;the British business man Richard Caring</a>. In&nbsp;November of&nbsp;2005&nbsp;an astonishing extravaganza took place in&nbsp;the Catherine Palace of&nbsp;Pushkin
        (Tsarskoye Selo), former suburban residence of&nbsp;the Russian Tsars. The world famous Amber Room is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the numerous interiors of&nbsp;the Catherine Palace.
